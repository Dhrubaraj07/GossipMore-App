# WhatsApp Web Application
WhatsApp Web is a browser-based extension of the popular mobile messaging application, WhatsApp. It allows users to access their WhatsApp account and chat with contacts through a web browser on their computer. To use WhatsApp Web, users need to scan a QR code displayed on the computer screen using the WhatsApp app on their mobile device. Once connected, users can send and receive messages, media files, and voice notes directly from their computer, making it convenient for multitasking and typing on a larger keyboard. While the web version mirrors the conversations from the mobile app, it requires an active internet connection on both devices. Additionally, the security of WhatsApp Web is maintained through end-to-end encryption, ensuring the privacy and confidentiality of the messages.
